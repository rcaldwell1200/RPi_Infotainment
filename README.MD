# RPi_Infotainment

RPi_Infotainment is mostly just a working repo to hold all of the components for the project until they work and can be turned in to proper plugins for the Kodi ecosystem.

## Getting Started

This is something I'd like to know myself.

### Prerequisites

You want the pre-requisites huh? 
1. Have a car
2. Have a way to get obd2 info from the car into the RPI (Bluetooth works for wireless, but I find it's too slow or gets interrupted. Wired USB adapters all the way)
3. Have an RPi 
4. 12 inch monitor for the infotainment center
5. A good background in automotive bus protocols and linux helps out a lot here.


```
Example: Hey Google. What are the specifications on the Local Interconnect Network bus?

```

## Deployment

Eventually this will (hopefully) be deployable via standardized Kodi plugin packages.
